# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose a security issue in this project.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow the process below so we can address it promptly and safely.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private security advisory / vulnerability reporting flow: open the repository on GitHub and choose **Security** â†’ **Report a vulnerability**. This will notify repository maintainers privately.

Do NOT open a public issue with vulnerability details. If you must use public channels, provide only a general summary and request a private channel for details.

## What to include

Please include the following when you report a potential vulnerability:

- A short summary of the issue and impact.
- Steps to reproduce (preferably a minimal example or PoC).
- The affected version(s) of the software.
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations, if available.
- Your contact information and whether you'd like credit.

## Supported versions

This project follows semantic versioning. Security fixes will be backported to supported minor versions at the maintainers' discretion. If you report a vulnerability, indicate which versions you consider affected.

## After a report

Once a fix is available we will:

- Notify the reporter.
- Publish a fixed release and tag the commit.

## Exceptions & disclaimers

This policy only describes how to report vulnerabilities. It does not constitute legal advice and does not change the repository's license or terms.
